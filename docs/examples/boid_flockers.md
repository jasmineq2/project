# Boids Flockers

## Summary

An implementation of Craig Reynolds's Boids flocker model. Agents (simulated birds) try to fly towards the average position of their neighbors and in the same direction as them, while maintaining a minimum distance. This produces flocking behavior.

This model tests Mesa's continuous space feature, and uses numpy arrays to represent vectors. It also demonstrates how to create custom visualization components.

## Installation

To install the dependencies use pip and the requirements.txt in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

* To launch the visualization interactively, run ``mesa runserver`` in this directory. e.g.

```
$ mesa runserver
```

or

Directly run the file ``run.py`` in the terminal. e.g.

```
    $ python run.py
```

* Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.

## Files

* [model.py](model.py): Core model file; contains the Boid Model and Boid Agent class.
* [app.py](app.py): Visualization code.

## Agents

```python
import numpy as np

from mesa import Agent


class Boid(Agent):
    """A Boid-style flocker agent.

    The agent follows three behaviors to flock:
        - Cohesion: steering towards neighboring agents.
        - Separation: avoiding getting too close to any other agent.
        - Alignment: try to fly in the same direction as the neighbors.

    Boids have a vision that defines the radius in which they look for their
    neighbors to flock with. Their speed (a scalar) and direction (a vector)
    define their movement. Separation is their desired minimum distance from
    any other Boid.
