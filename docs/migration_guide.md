# Mesa Migration guide
This guide contains breaking changes between major Mesa versions and how to resolve them.

Non-breaking changes aren't included, for those see our [Release history](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/releases).

## Mesa 3.0
<!-- TODO small introduction-->

_This guide is a work in progress. The development of it is tracked in [Issue #2233](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues/2233)._

### Reserved and private variables
<!-- TODO: Update this section based on https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2230 -->

#### Reserved variables
Currently, we have reserved the following variables:
  - Model: `agents`, `current_id`, `random`, `running`, `steps`, `time`.
  - Agent: `unique_id`, `model`.

You can use (read) any reserved variable, but Mesa may update them automatically and rely on them, so modify/update at your own risk.
#### Private variables
Any variables starting with an underscore (`_`) are considered private and for Mesa's internal use. We might use any of those. Modifying or overwriting any private variable is at your own risk.

- Ref: [Discussion #2230](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2230), [PR #2225](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2225)


### Removal of `mesa.flat` namespace
The `mesa.flat` namespace is removed. Use the full namespace for your imports.

- Ref: [PR #2091](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2091)


### Automatic assignment of `unique_id` to Agents
<!-- TODO -->

- Ref: [PR #2226](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2226)


### AgentSet and `Model.agents`
#### AgentSet
<!-- TODO  -->

#### `Model.agents`
<!-- TODO  -->


### Time and schedulers
<!-- TODO general explanation-->

#### Automatic increase of the `steps` counter
The `steps` counter is now automatically increased. With each call to `Model.steps()` it's increased by 1, at the beginning of the step.

You can access it by `Model.steps`, and it's internally in the datacollector, batchrunner and the visualisation.

- Ref: [PR #2223](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2223), Mesa-examples [PR #161](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/161)

#### Removal of `Model._time` and rename `._steps`
- `Model._time` is removed. You can define your own time variable if needed.
- `Model._steps` steps is renamed to `Model.steps`.

#### Removal of `Model._advance_time()`
- The `Model._advance_time()` method is removed. This now happens automatically.

<!-- TODO deprecate all schedulers? -->


### Visualisation

Mesa has adopted a new API for our frontend. If you already migrated to the experimental new SolaraViz you can still use
the import from mesa.experimental. Otherwise here is a list of things you need to change.

#### Model Initialization

Previously SolaraViz was initialized by providing a `model_cls` and a `model_params`. This has changed to expect a model instance `model`. You can still provide (user-settable) `model_params`, but only if users should be able to change them. It is now also possible to pass in a "reactive model" by first calling `model = solara.reactive(model)`. This is useful for notebook environments. It allows you to pass the model to the SolaraViz Module, but continue to use the model. For example calling `model.value.step()` (notice the extra .value) will automatically update the plots. This currently only automatically works for the step method, you can force visualization updates by calling `model.value.force_update()`.

#### Default space visualization

Previously we included a default space drawer that you could configure with an `agent_portrayal` function. You now have to explicitly create a space drawer with the `agent_portrayal` function

```python
# old
from mesa.experimental import SolaraViz

SolaraViz(model_cls, model_params, agent_portrayal=agent_portrayal)

# new
from mesa.visualization import SolaraViz, make_space_matplotlib

SolaraViz(model, components=[make_space_matplotlib(agent_portrayal)])
```

#### Plotting "measures"

"Measure" plots also need to be made explicit here. Previously, measure could either be 1) A function that receives a model and returns a solara component or 2) A string or list of string of variables that are collected by the datacollector and are to be plotted as a line plot. 1) still works, but you can pass that function to "components" directly. 2) needs to explicitly call the `make_plot_measure()`function.

```python
# old
from mesa.experimental import SolaraViz

def make_plot(model):
    ...

SolaraViz(model_cls, model_params, measures=[make_plot, "foo", ["bar", "baz"]])

# new
from mesa.visualization import SolaraViz, make_plot_measure

SolaraViz(model, components=[make_plot, make_plot_measure("foo"), make_plot_measure("bar", "baz")])
```

#### Plotting text

To plot model-dependent text the experimental SolaraViz provided a `make_text` function that wraps another functions that receives the model and turns its string return value into a solara text component. Again, this other function can now be passed directly to the new SolaraViz components array. It is okay if your function just returns a string.

```python
# old
from mesa.experimental import SolaraViz, make_text

def show_steps(model):
    return f"Steps: {model.steps}"

SolaraViz(model_cls, model_params, measures=make_text(show_steps))

# new
from mesa.visualisation import SolaraViz

def show_steps(model):
    return f"Steps: {model.steps}"

SolaraViz(model, components=[show_steps])
```
